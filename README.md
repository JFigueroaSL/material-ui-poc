### Starter Project for the Material UI playlist

Download the code & run **npm install** to install dependencies before starting the app.

You'll need to install `JSON Server` globally:

```
npm install -g json-server
```

And after that you can make it run:

```
json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000
```

Last but not least, run the React App:

```
npm start
```
